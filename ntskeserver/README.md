# Network Time Security Key Exchange server

This server can be used in an [NTS
system](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ntp-using-nts-for-ntp/)
to establish the initial key exchange and cookie distribution between
an NTS client and an NTS/NTP server.

It's connected with the these projects:

- [ntske](https://gitlab.com/hacklunch/ntkse) NTS-KE Go package.
- [ntsclient](https://gitlab.com/hacklunc/ntsclient): A simple NTS client.
- [ntp](https://hack.org/mchackorg/ntp): An NTP and NTS client
  package.
